## What is this?

This is an app that helps display Leeds City Council [site allocations data](http://github.com/rgarner/lcc-site-allocations-data) scraped
from a number of PDFs held in council minutes. That data was effectively locked up there, requiring a lot of cross-referencing effort to use.

## What does it do?

This has all the sites that those PDFs know about. Some of those sites have scores that helped decide to allocate them,
some do not (use the 'With'/'Without' buttons to see which).

## Why did we make this?

The site allocations process can be contentious. We need strong evidence-based policy to be behind the allocation of sites.
However, a site very dear to us (<%= link_to('Red Hall Playing Fields', '/sites/2062') %>) has several glaring errors
in key categories. A decision to allocate has been based on these errors.

We want to see these errors corrected or acknowledged. We do not want to see valuable public space owned by Leeds City
Council sacrificed to the development rush.
